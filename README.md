- Use of your CRUD web pages: which button or UI is used to implement create, read, update, and delete?

//Create and read
After logging in, the dashboard displays an "Add Your First Task" button. Users can click this button to open a form for creating a new task, where they enter details such as Title* (required), Description, Due Date, Priority, and Status. At the bottom of the form, an "Add Task" button submits the entry, successfully creating the task. 

Users can also create additional tasks by clicking the "+ Add New Task" button, located next to the calendar and timer buttons.

//Update
The task then appears in the "My Tasks" page. To edit any details, users click the "Edit" button next to the task, modify the desired information in the form, and click the "Update Task" button at the bottom. The changes are saved, and the updated task is reflected immediately in the list.

//Delete
To delete a task, users click the "Delete" button. A confirmation dialog appears with the message "Are you sure you want to delete this task?" Clicking "Yes" permanently removes the task from the list.
